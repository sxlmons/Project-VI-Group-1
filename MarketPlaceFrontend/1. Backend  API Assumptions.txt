1. Backend / API Assumptions

2. Frontend / React Assumptions

React Router is used:

/login → Login page

/register → Create Account page

/home → Landing page (carousel + categories)

/account → Account profile page

/posts/:postId → Post Details page

/posts/:postId/edit → Edit Post page

Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to /login

Session authentication is handled entirely via cookies; no token in localStorage

API responses are JSON

Owner-specific UI:

Edit/Delete post buttons are visible only if isOwner: true

Edit/Delete comment buttons are visible only if isOwner: true

Images are handled as base64 strings for simplicity in React forms

Forms are controlled components with validation for required fields

3. UI / UX Assumptions

Landing page shows posts prioritized by user location

Posts can optionally include multiple images

Comments are editable and deletable by their creator only

Feedback is provided via success/error messages

All forms and pages are responsive

Confirmation prompts are shown before destructive actions (delete post/comment)

4. System / Deployment Assumptions

Frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL database will be containerized

Frontend communicates with backend via HTTP (or HTTPS in production)

Logging of all user interactions is handled server-side:

Login/logout

Account edits

Post create/edit/delete

Comment create/edit/delete

5. Stretch / Optional Features

Post creators can flag inappropriate comments

Moderator role exists to handle flagged comments

Location-based filtering beyond user’s location may exist
